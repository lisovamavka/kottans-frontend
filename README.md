### About me :raising_hand:
For the last few months, I have taught myself Html and CSS, and sometimes I found myself playing with code and trying to build small static web pages. It was super fun and I enjoyed it a lot! But then I realized that I wanted more. I want to become a front-end developer, so that's the reason why I'm here with you. Thank you for this opportunity.
Oh, I nearly forgot, I'm Vika, and here's my repo where I will describe my path through this course! So here goes!

## Git basics
**In this module:**

>I listened to 1st and 2nd modules of [this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github). Git was entirely new for me, and I hadn't worked with it before. So from the lecturer, I learned about Git's core functionality and consolidated the gained knowledge into practice by making this repository. During practice, I often used main commands, such as *git init, git add, git status, git commit, git branch, etc.* â€” wow, I can use this mysterious terminal!

>Also, I passed the required levels in [this game](https://learngitbranching.js.org/): *Introduction Sequence, Ramping up and Push & Pull -- Git remotes!* (screenshots are below). The first levels were not challenging, but let's see how I cope with the next ones. I'm passionate about learning with gamification elements cause it helps me remember things better.
